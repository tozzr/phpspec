phpspec
=======

php clone of the beautiful rspec. with that in mind - you want your specs to like this:

```php
describe("some awesome feature", function() {
  it("should be the hottest thing around", function() {
    expect(new CoolFeature()->run())->to_equal("best ever");
  });
});
```
and then your rocket ramps up leaving all the rest behind.

happy coding!
